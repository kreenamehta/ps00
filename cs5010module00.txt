Ex 3: Write the definition of a function that converts a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. The formula for the conversion is C = (F-32) * (5/9) . The contract, purpose statement and examples for this function are:

    ; RETURNS: the equivalent temperature in degrees Celsius.
    ; Examples:
    ; (f->c 32)  => 0

Ex 4: Define a function called tip that takes two arguments, a number representing the amount of a bill in dollars, and a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the percentage of tip one wants to give (e.g. 0.15 = 15%). tip should return the amount of the tip in dollars. The contract, purpose statement, and examples of tip are the following:

    ; tip : NonNegNumber Number[0.0,1.0] -> Number
    ; GIVEN: the amount of the bill in dollars and the
    ; percentage of tip
    ; RETURNS: the amount of the tip in dollars.
    ; Examples:
    ; (tip 10 0.15)  => 1.5
    ; (tip 20 0.17)  => 3.4

Ex 7: Define a function called circumference that computes the circumference of a circle. The contract, purpose statement, and usage of circumference are:

    ; circumference : Number -> Number
    ; GIVEN: the radius r of a circle 
    ; RETURNS: its circumference, using the formula 2 * pi * r.
    ; Examples:
    ; (circumference 1)  =>  6.283185307179586

Ex 8: The area included in a circle of radius r is given by the formula pi * r^2. Using the interaction window of DrRacket as a calculator, compute the area included in circles of radius 1, 5, and 7.

Write the contract, purpose statement, examples, and the definition of a function called circle-area that computes the area included in a circle of radius r, using the above formula. Use the three calculations you did above as your examples.

;RETURNS : the area of the circle

Ex 9: Find out what the operator remainder does by typing it in the definitions window, highlighting it, and pressing F1.

Try applying remainder on some examples to make sure you understand what it does. (what is its difference with modulo?)

Define a predicate even? that takes a number as an argument and returns true if this number is divisible by 2, and false otherwise. (You will probably need to use remainder or something similar in the implementation of even?.)

file:///Applications/Racket%20v6.1/doc/search/index.html?q=remainder

       [else false]))

> (even 5)
false

;GIVEN: three numbers
;RETURNS: the sum of the two largest numbers out of three
;Example:
;> (sum 8 9 0) => 17
;> (sum 6 5 1) => 11
